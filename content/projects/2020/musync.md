This is similar to [Populate](https://github.com/cronokirby/populate).

This is a program that can clone a music library based on its description. It can download
albums, split them automatically, and add metadata to these songs, like cover art and names.

It uses `youtube-dl` for the downloading, and `ffmpeg` for the splitting.
