### Text3

Yo what's up peeps!

Try **bold** text and *italic* text

Let's try [links](https://github.com/cronokirby)

Here's some `inline code`.

Here's a full code block:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Here's a comment
int main() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
    printf("%d", i);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

And then text

```haskell
foo :: String
foo = "Hello World!"

main :: IO ()
main = do
  putStrLn "Hello World!"
```
