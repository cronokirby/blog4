I'm Lúcás: currently a senior BSc student in Computer Science
at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/).

This is my personal website, where I write blog posts somewhat regularly, and keep a tab on
all the projects I'm working on.

I've been programming since 2017 or so, and I try to have a somewhat public profile on the things I do.
My main interests are Functional Programming, Web Programming, Distributed Programming, and Programming Languages.
I've programmed in a plethora of languages, from **C**, to **Go**, to **Scala**, to **Java**, **Haskell**, **Python**,
etc. having written small to large-ish projects in each of them. I'd say I could pick up anything quickly enough though.

I also like Math quite a bit, so that's a recurring topic in my posts as well. Interests there
include **Algebra** and **Category Theory**.

# [Posts](/posts)

I try and write a blog post every week or so, usually on either technical topics, or about some
topic in Math. The posts often stem from ongoing work on whatever projects I'm working on at some
point in time.

If you want to stay up to date, I'd recommend checking out the [RSS feed](/posts/index.xml).

# [Projects](/projects)

The vast majority of my programming work involves working on side-projects. These range from small
weekend-projects, to games, to libraries, to programming languages! I also recommend
checking out my [Github](https://github.com/cronokirby) for an even more complete overview.


## [Notes](/notes)

I sometimes put up rough notes for things I'm studying, or working on here.
