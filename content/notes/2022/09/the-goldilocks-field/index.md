The field of prime order:

$$
p = 2^{64} - 2^{32} + 1
$$

has some nice properties for ZK proofs, notably STARKs.

The order of $\mathbb{F}_p^*$ is $p - 1$, which is equal to:

$$
2^{64} - 2^{32} = 2^{32} \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 17 \cdot 257 \cdot 65537
$$

This means that the field has a $2^{32}$th root of unity, which is very
useful.

$\mathbb{F}_p^*$ is generated by:

$$
g = 7
$$

And taking $g^{(p - 1) / 2^{32}}$ gives us our root of unity:

$$
\omega = \texttt{0x185629dcda58878c}
$$
