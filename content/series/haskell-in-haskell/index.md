This is a series I'm writing about implementing a compiler for a subset of Haskell, using
nothing else than Haskell itself! We'll go through the whole process, going from a file
containing Haskell code to generating C that we can compile into a functional
executable.

I've only just started working on the series, so stay
tuned for new posts as they come along: I'll update this page whenever they arrive.
