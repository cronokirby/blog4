Recently, I've been experimenting with using *spaced repetition*
for self-studying "advanced" mathematics. This post goes through
my motivations for adopting this system, as well as a few techniques
to adapt it to mathematics.

# What is Spaced Repetition

After being reminded of some fact, or re-working some problem, you're immediately
more familiar with it. If you're quizzed about that problem
soon after, you'll be able to recall the solution without much effort.
But, if you don't visit this problem for long enough, you'll eventually forget
this solution. The better you've understood something, the longer it takes
to forget it.

The idea behind *spaced repetition* is to reintroduce ideas and problems
right *before* you forget them, forcing you to engage with the idea once more,
refreshing your memory. This is *spaced*, in the sense that the periods without
recall get longer and longer, as your knowledge becomes further and further solidified.

A Spaced Repetition System, or SRS, for short, is some piece of software, or
even analog system, that allows you to create "flashcards" which include some form
of prompt, and some form of answer. The system then quizzes you on these cards, so that
you're able to recall the information when prompted. It repeats these quizzes in a spaced
way, to try and keep the information fresh, or recallable, while spacing reviews
out as you get better at recalling that information.

In practice, the system prompts you for some information, and then you reveal the
answer, and mark that information as recalled or forgotten. If you recalled
the information correctly, then the waiting period until you see that information
again gets longer. If you fail, on the other hand, then the waiting period shortens,
or even gets reset, in some systems.

# Why Spaced Repetition?

The promise of an SRS is being able to actually keep the information
you learn through studying fresh, as opposed to having it slowly attrition away.
A lot of information is "use it or lose it", and if you don't actively use
some technique or knowledge, you risk just forgetting it. SRS systems try
to game your memory, by having you "use it" right before you would forget it.

Personally, I've found it a more compelling alternative to note-taking. In practice,
I basically never reviewed the notes for courses I took, even if I did so studiously,
like at the beginning of my degree.

I think of a spaced repetition system as a way to actively review your notes
and findings in an automated way, so that you don't spend needless time
reviewing things you already know well, or forget to review things that you
don't have a solid grasp on.

Since the system spaces information based on whether you've managed to recall
that information, it keeps things fresh, without wasting your time.

With this kind of system in place, my "permanent" notes migrate towards
pieces of knowledge I want to remember. I still use pen-and-paper notes,
but this is more so for *engaging* with material as I learn it, and not for
revisiting later. The SRS takes care of scheduling my revisiting for me.
