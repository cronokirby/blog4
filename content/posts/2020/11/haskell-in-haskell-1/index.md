# Introduction

- What we're going to accomplish in this post

# Haskell Tools

What tools do we need for the project, and why.

## Compiler

## Build Tool

- Cabal vs Stack basically

## Why Cabal

- Cabal
- Hopefully the project is timeless anyways

## ghcup

- What is ghcup, and why do we need it?

- Link to the website

- Describe setup process

# Cabal Project

Terminal Setup.

Inspecting the cabal file.

# Library

What the library portion is.

Creating it inside the cabal file.

Writing a toy example

# Executable

What the executable is for

Writing a toy example.

# Custom Prelude

What a custom prelude is.

## Why a Custom Prelude

- Deficiencies in the standard Prelude

- The ability to include commonly used functions

- Some of the alternatives

- Why just use a simple one

## Operators we're including

- Personal

## Editing Cabal File

- The no prelude extension
- Changing base libraries

## Fixing The other parts of the project

- Fixing library code
- Fixing executable code
- Running everything

# Conclusion

- What we've covered in this post
- The code for this section
